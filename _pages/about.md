## Short CV

I am a "Beatriz Galindo" (tenure-track) “Distinguished (Junior) Professor” of Aerospace Engineering at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM). I previously served as an Interim Professor at RWTH Aachen University, as a Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Cologne (UoC), and as a Marie-Curie Early Stage Researcher at UPM. I am a Mechanical Engineer and hold a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering. My research focuses on modern high-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for computational fluid dynamics and plasma physics, as well as in developing high-performance parallel computing tools.
