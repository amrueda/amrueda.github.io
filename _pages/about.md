## Short CV

I am a "Beatriz Galindo" (tenure-track) “Distinguished (Junior) Professor” at the [Department of Applied Mathematics in Aerospace Engineering](https://numath.dmae.upm.es/) of the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM). I previously served as an Interim Professor at RWTH Aachen University, as a Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Cologne, and as a "Marie Skłodowska-Curie" Early Stage Researcher at UPM. I am a Mechanical Engineer and hold a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering. My research focuses on modern high-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for computational fluid dynamics and plasma physics, as well as in developing high-performance parallel computing tools.
